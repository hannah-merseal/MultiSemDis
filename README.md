# Multilingual AUT Dataset

In an international and collaborative effort, we have collected 28 AUT datasets across 11 languages. Each dataset varies on a number of parameters including participants, instructions, number of raters, and additional measures that may be used for secondary analyses (e.g., creative achievements).

Please find additional details of our first analysis of these data in a forthcoming paper (in prep) titled "Multilingual Semantic Distance: Automatic Verbal Creativity Assessment in Many Languages".
